            Dindigul Fort is a historic hill fort built on a large rock in Dindigul, Tamil Nadu. It was constructed by the Madurai Nayakas in the 17th century and later strengthened by Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan. The fort was used as a military base because of its strong structure and high viewpoint. Today, it is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India and is a popular tourist attraction.
